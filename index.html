  <!-- paragraph -->
  <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by <strong>the <u><em>readable content</em></u> of a page</strong> when looking at its layout.<br>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
<br>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.<br>Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (<small>injected humour and the like.</small>)
